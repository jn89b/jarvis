class ProportionalNavigation3DHeuristicRLM(RLModule):
    """
    A heuristic RLModule that implements a 3D proportional navigation (PN) guidance law.
    It outputs commands for pitch, yaw, and velocity.

    Assumes each observation is a vector of shape (7,) containing:
      [rx, ry, rz, vx, vy, vz, current_speed]
    where:
      - (rx, ry, rz): relative position (from missile to target)
      - (vx, vy, vz): relative velocity (target relative to missile)
      - current_speed: the missile's current speed

    The PN law is implemented as:
         a_cmd = N * v_closing * (r x (v x r)) / ||r||^3

    The lateral acceleration a_cmd is then converted into pitch and yaw commands
    using small-angle approximations (assuming the missileâ€™s velocity is aligned
    with its x-axis):
         pitch_command = arctan(-a_cmd_z / current_speed)
         yaw_command   = arctan(a_cmd_y / current_speed)

    The velocity command is set to a nominal value.
